Syntaxer
========

A Syntax Highlighter module for ContentBox and a plugin for CKEditor

This module allows you to customize how you use Syntax Highlighter for your <pre> and <code> tags within your ContentBox pages and posts. You can set default themes, brushes, and even define global rules for how Syntax Highlighter should be implemented by default.

The CKEditor plugin allows you to easily insert customizable <pre> and <code> blocks directly into your pages and posts. By default, your inserted syntax blocks will inherit the defaults set in the plugin, but you can also override them instance by instance by the handy plugin dialog.
